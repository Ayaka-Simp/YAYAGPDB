# YAYAGPDB, the dumb discord bot made by the one and only, Veemo-9785

This is so dumb.

## Usage

After cloning, install dependencies with `$ npm init`.

If you want to work on this with your own test bot, make a config.json and paste this text in:

```json
{
  "token": "your-token-goes-here"
}
```

## Contributing

I doubt anyone will read this/actually contribute but...

Fork the repository and start working on in. Then start a pull request and I'll review it.
